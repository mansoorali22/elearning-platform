# FAST E-Learning Platform

A Java-based desktop application developed as a final project for the Software Design and Analysis course. The FAST E-Learning Platform is designed to streamline and enhance the digital learning experience by offering centralized access to academic materials, interactive tools, and course management functionalities.

## Project Overview

The FAST E-Learning Platform was created in response to the increasing demand for digital education solutions at FAST-NUCES. Traditional methods of handling academic resources were often inefficient, fragmented, and lacked interactivity. This platform resolves those challenges by offering a unified solution that simplifies course management and improves communication between students, faculty, and alumni.

The system integrates with existing university databases to ensure smooth operation within the institutional infrastructure. It was built with scalability, security, and usability in mind, supporting future growth and extended usage across departments.
